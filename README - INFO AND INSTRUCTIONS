README - INFO AND INSTRUCTIONS

To compile program with gcc:

gcc -ggdb `pkg-config --cflags opencv` -o `basename maskMaker.c .c` maskMaker.c `pkg-config --libs opencv`

------------------------------------------

To run program:
./maskMaker videoName.extension maskPic.extension

Then, enter the dimensions of your region of interest to crop the maskPic image. If no region of interest is desired,
the whole maskPic image will be used.
  To avoid a squashed image, use dimensions close to a square (width and height equal or almost equal).

Notes:

Video playback is slower than original video speed.
Through testing, it seems playback is affected by internet connection speed. Video playback was much faster on home network
than school network.

Project done on Windows:
X forwarding when connecting to tux64-14, using Xming server and Putty as an SSH client.
