README - INFO AND INSTRUCTIONS

To compile program with gcc:

gcc -ggdb `pkg-config --cflags opencv` -o `basename maskMaker.c .c` maskMaker.c `pkg-config --libs opencv`

------------------------------------------

To run program:
./maskMaker videoName.avi maskPic.extension

Then, enter the dimensions of your region of interest to crop the maskPic image. If no region of interest is desired,
the whole maskPic image will be used.
Dimensions for cropping found using the selection tool in Microsoft Paint (dimensions of selections found on bottom
left hand corner).
To avoid a squashed image, use dimensions close to a square (width and height equal or almost equal).

Region of Interest Dimensions For Starter Masks Used During Testing

TIM.jpg: 150 x 150 or 131 x 173

batman.jpg: 186 x 305

finn.jpg: 161x151

minion.jpg: 341 x 357

le_happy_face.png: 573 x 573

lego: 171x185

Notes:

Could not access webcam through tux, so user provided videos are used in the program instead. Webcam capture could be used
in the future by changing cvCaptureFromAVI(input_name) to cvCaptureFromCAM(device_number)

Ran into trouble with grabcut implementation. User customized cropping used as substitute. 

Video playback is slower than original video speed.
Through testing, it seems playback is affected by internet connection speed. Video playback was much faster on home network
than school network.

Project done on Windows:
X forwarding when connecting to tux64-14, using Xming server and Putty as an SSH client.
